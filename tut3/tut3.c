TUTORIAL 3

Question:

Write a complete C program that first prompts the user to enter a floating point
number between 0 and 10, and its number of digits after the decimal point (no
greater than 7). It will then print all possible two-digit numbers found in
consecutive digits of the floating point number that the user entered. For
example, if the number entered is 2.7182818, and the number of digits entered is
7, the two-digit numbers printed are:

    Enter a floating point number between 0 and 10: 2.7182818
    Enter the number of digits after the decimal point: 7
    27
    71
    18
    82
    28
    81
    18
