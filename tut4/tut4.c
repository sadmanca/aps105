TUTORIAL 4
Question:

Write a C program that receives an input number and checks if it can be
expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. If it is, print out all possible
combinations.

Your code should have a function named checkPrime, and it returns a boolean. The
checkPrime function checks if the number is prime number and return a boolean
value. Start by implementing this function first. Using break is okay, but not
preferred coding style. You should know how to write your code without it.

Sample output:

    Enter a positive integer: 56
    56 can be expressed as the sum of 3 and 53.
    56 can be expressed as the sum of 13 and 43.
    56 can be expressed as the sum of 19 and 37.

Another sample output:

    Enter a positive integer: 11
    11 cannot be expressed as a sum of two prime numbers.

NOT sample output:

    The second input is redundant in the following example:
    Enter a positive integer: 5
    5 can be expressed as the sum of 2 and 3.
    5 can be expressed as the sum of 3 and 2.
