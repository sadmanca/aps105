/*
Part 3 â€” Unit Conversion

Write a C program that asks the user to enter a distance (assumed to be in metres). Convert this
distance to yards, feet, inches and a decimal number, rounded to two decimal places, that indicates
any remaining fraction of an inch. Use the conversion factor 1 inch = 2.54 cm. For example, if the
user enters a value of 3.376, the output will be:

    3 yards, 2 feet, 0 inches, 0.91 inches remainder

The prompt to the user should take the form:

    Please provide a distance in metres:

written by itself on a single line.

Note: if the input leads to something like the following:

    1 yards, 1 feet, 1 inches, 0.00 inches remainder
    
This is fine. You do not need to change the output to read 1 yard, 1 foot, 1 inch. Likewise, if
yards, feet or inches have a value of 0, no need to remove their prints from the output.
