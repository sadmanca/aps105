TUTORIAL 2

Question 2:

Akarsh is in the wild, and he wants to cross a path. He observes that this path
is divided into small blocks, where every three blocks he observes small needles
and every four blocks he observes rocks. He does not want to step on rocks or
needles. Akarsh is strong enough to jump from 8 to 20 blocks in one jump. 

Write a program in C that helps Akarsh jump a random number of blocks from 8 to
20 and tells him if he is stepping on rocks or needles or both. Assume Akarsh is
standing on block 0, where there are rocks or needles, but Akrash is standing on
a wooden piece.

Sample output is: 

    He will jump 17 blocks and hit the ground! Yaay! 
    He will jump 15 blocks and hit needles.
    He will jump 9 blocks and hit needles and rocks.
