TUTORIAL 1

Question:

Write a C program that asks the user to enter a time instant in the month, by
sequentially entering the day in the month, the hour in the day, the minute in
the hour, and the second in the minute. Calculate (1) how many seconds have
elapsed since the first second of the month; (2) how many minutes have elapsed
since the first minute; (3) how many hours have elapsed since the first hour;
and (4) how many days have elapsed since the first day (day 1). All
floating-point values to be printed should be rounded to two decimal places.

A run of your program should look like the following:

    Enter the day in the month: 15
    Enter the hour in the day: 20
    Enter the minute in the hour: 15
    Enter the second in the minute: 30

    Do you know that time is precious?
    1282530 seconds, or 21375.50 minutes, or 356.26 hours, or 14.84 days have elapsed since the beginning of the month
