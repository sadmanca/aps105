TUTORIAL 6 Question 1:

In this question, we will be implementing a string subtraction algorithm. The program will prompt the user to enter a random number of characters between 6 and 10 followed by another random number of characters between 3 and 5. The program will then remove the second string from the first string if it exists within it. Example runs of the program are shown below:

    Enter 9 characters: abcdefghi
    Enter 4 characters: defg

    Phrase: abcdefghi
    Remove: defg
    Result: abchi

    Enter 6 characters: abcdef
    Enter 5 characters: tests

    Phrase: abcdef
    Remove: tests
    Result: abcdef

    Enter 8 characters: abcdefgh
    Enter 4 characters: abcd

    Phrase: abcdefgh
    Remove: abcd
    Result: efgh
