/*
TUTORIAL 6 Question 2:

In this question, we will be implementing a string search system. Assume your program has the string "I go to the University of Toronto." already defined. Your task is to read a character input from the user and find the location(s) of that character in the string. Example outputs from the program are as follows:

    String: "I go to the University of Toronto."
    Enter a character: n
    Found at index 13
    Found at index 30

    String: "I go to the University of Toronto."
    Enter a character: a
    Character not found.

    String: "I go to the University of Toronto."
    Enter a character: v
    Found at index 15
